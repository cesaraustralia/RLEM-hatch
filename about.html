    The redlegged earth mite (RLEM) is a common and widespread pest of pastures and most broadacre crops. Adult mites are approximately 1 mm in length with a velvety black body and 8 orange-red coloured legs. Redlegged earth mites are commonly controlled using insecticides, however, non-chemical options are becoming increasingly important due to evidence of resistance and concerns about long-term sustainability.

    This webtool aims to improve RLEM control outcomes through more precise monitorring and well-timed control applications. If pest control strategies are used too early, they may have no impact while the mites remain unhatched. If pest control is undertaken too late, economic damage to the crop may occur. Thus, it is important to carefully time RLEM monitorring and control efforts.

    This web tool was developed by James Maino through a GRDC investment (CES2010-001RXT) with contributions from Cesar Australia, the University of Melbourne, the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, and CSIRO. The tool is based on past research by McDonald et al. (2015) on rainfall and temperature requirements for hatching of over-summering eggs of the redlegged earth mite. See McDonald et al. (2015) for details on the underlying algorithm. Climate data is provided through the Queensland government's SILO database which makes gridded Australian climate data available from 1889 to yesterday.
